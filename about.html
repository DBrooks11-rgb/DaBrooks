                <article>
                    <section class="box" id="center">
                        <p>I was always interested in technology, from video games
                                to computers and coding. Ever since high school,
                                it felt like my destiny was a degree in Computer Science.
                                <br>
                                In a way, I suppose I still obtained the knowledge.
                                But why switch to Informatics, and what exactly does it 
                                mean for me as a person? 
                            </p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="aboutbox">
                        <h3>Me?...Me!</h3>
                        <div class="box" id="center">
                            <p>
                            Born and raised in Indiana, technology was always around me.
                            I like being curious about things I don&rsquo;t know, even
                            when it doesn&rsquo;t always spark my interest. Although, 
                            sometimes it&rsquo;s better to hear things from someone else 
                            rather than doing things yourself. I&rsquo;ve had to
                            learn this lesson time and time again as I 
                            started developing qualities to lead and take action.
                        </p>
                        <p>Learning to be flexible is another big lesson
                            that I believe holds true to this day.
                            Life hasn&rsquo;t gone the way I always thought it would, 
                            but you learn to make the most of it.
                            Going through many unique times in life,
                            I&rsquo;ve learned alot about things that often
                            labelled me "wiser" beyond my age, even though
                            I never thought I was back then.
                            <br><br>
                            Personally, I think everyone is smart in their own way, but
                            we can&rsquo;t always explain how. We&rsquo;re all 
                            normal people after all, just with different perspectives.
                        </p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Why Informatics?</h3>

                            <figure>
                                <img id="verticalimg" src="images/Informatics_example.png"

                            </figure>

                            <div class="invisibox-2">
                                <p>
                                    With so many paths and
                                    careers set in stone, I choose one of the newer and
                                    "easier" degree paths. Although, I don&rsquo;t see Informatics
                                    as "easy".
                                    <br>
                                    Informatics, to me at least, is the bridge between people and technology.
                                    Not everyone understands technology, and for many of us,
                                    learning something new isn&rsquo;t always so simple. Futhermore,
                                    teaching someone a new technology can be difficult in certain
                                    senerios.
                                    Without that bridge to better connect people with that technology,
                                    users get stuck in the dreaded "black box" senerio.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I&rsquo;ve been able to meet many Informatics majors throughout college,
                                    and what I realized is that Informatics is like a
                                    wild card in a deck of cards. People who know Informatics
                                    are TALENTED. Coding, making robots with motherboards, sports, making music,
                                    works of art, and so on. Informatics teaches you that there is
                                    always another way, even when the cards are against you.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Hard to believe right? I had my doubts too, but our four-person
                                    Informatics Capstone team,
                                    turned into three-person team midway through the first semester, was praised
                                    by many judges and rewarded (with money) by our colleages, many of which were
                                    Computer Science majors (who also had impressive projects of course).
