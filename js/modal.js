                    on providing tools and resources to help those facing addiction to nicotine.
                    I worked with Camilla Clark and Kevin Trancong to create a fully functional
                    site that works with an SQL database and integrated Google API systems.
                    I helped with back-end design, as well as extra input for front-end
                    design aspects after collecting input from real experts in medical and
                    UX design positions. This project required much time and effort to make
                    it a reality, but I&rsquo;m very proud of how it came out in the end.`,

                    many people overlook. This tableau project aims to put my data analyst
